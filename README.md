# Traffic-Simulator

Object Oriented Design, Generics and Collections in Java.

A simulation allows a model to be run on a computer so that its behaviour can be observed and applied to real life. This project consists of building a traffic simulator, which will model vehicles, roads and junctions, taking into account environmental pollution. There are different policies at crossings to allow vehicles to pass, different types of roads depending on the degree of pollution and vehicles with different environmental identifier. In this way model an application (using object-orientation) of a real-life problem.
